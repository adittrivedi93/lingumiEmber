	<h2>The Starter Kit</h2>
	<img src="assets/illustration.png">
	<h4>The Starter Kit is everything you need to start playing and learning with your child, using the Lingumi Method. The starter kit contains 6 squishy, colourful cubes that unlock a world of tactile, playful learning when paired with one of our 'First Series' apps or videos. You can see how the kit works here, or read testimonials from some of our Lingumi families here. Or, if you want to read about why we use physical objects as part of the Method, download the whitepaper here.</h4>

	<h4>Lingumi uses a variety of interactive physical and digital experiences to immerse children in a learning environment that is effective and beneficial. The <strong>Starter Kit</strong> works <strong>offline</strong> and requires <strong>no batteries</strong>. It is compatible with Apple iOS and Android tablets and smartphones, and can be setup in less than a minute.<br/> Once you've got the starter kit, the apps that go with it are free, and all of our languages (English, Italian, Spanish, French, Mandarin) are included.<br/>The cubes are made from child-safe, soft foam that won't break anything (tablets, precious vases, hearts), and can be easily wiped clean.</h4>

	<h4>We create games that fulfil our key learning criteria: <strong>action-reaction</strong>, <strong>guesswork</strong>, and <strong>positive reinforcement</strong>. The result is rich, rewarding, and fun activities for children and parents.<br/>The four types of games cover four disciplines of language acquisition: learning new words, adding contextual language (like 'the' or 'big' or 'where') around these new words, understanding how these words fit into phrases, and then speaking the words and phrases out loud.</h4>

	<h4>Our starter kit has two apps: First Words, which teaches c.60 nouns and then test your child's memory of new words through puzzle games, alongside free-play areas, and magical and funny activities for different categories of words. The second app, First Verbs, takes the base of nouns that your child has learned, and adds verbs around these nouns to expand their knowledge of the language.</h4>
